## "What I’m Working On Right Now" – A Peek Behind the Curtain
*Part of the ongoing series exploring the technical challenges and growth of an engineer.*

As engineers, we’re often working on complex, ever-evolving projects that test our skills, patience, and sometimes, our sense of humour. Here’s what I’ve been up to recently, in my bid to balance technical problem-solving, personal growth, and making life a little easier for the people who rely on our systems every day.
### The Big Project: A New App for Store Colleagues
My main focus right now is helping to build a new in-store colleague app. The current application is nearing the end of its lifecycle, and it’s time for a replacement that’s more efficient, reliable, and better suited to the fast-paced, often chaotic world of retail.
This project is close to my heart—I used to be a store colleague myself. Knowing how frustrating slow or unreliable tools can be, I’m determined to create something that genuinely helps the people using it. Plus, there’s something satisfying about combining my technical skills with that real-world experience.
### Other Hats I’m Wearing
When I’m not deep in the code for the app, I’m:
* Supporting **festival teams** with technical solutions, because who doesn’t love a good festival?
* **Improving ways of working**—not just for myself, but for my team and as a representative for engineering colleagues across Co-op.
* **Building my personal brand** *(yes, this blog is part of that effort)*. Think *“nerdy but approachable”* with a touch of humour... hopefully.
### Challenges and Barcode Confusion
Let’s talk challenges. Some are technical—like learning Azure and NoSQL from scratch. (SQL was a good friend, but it was time to branch out.) Others are randomly specific, like discovering how much data can be crammed into a single barcode. It turns out, barcodes are not just simple lines—they’re secret keepers, and I’m still not sure I trust them...
Business logic is another beast entirely. Store environments aren’t simple; every process has quirks and exceptions. And just when you think you’ve accounted for everything, someone asks, “But what about this edge case?” (Cue facepalm.)
### Tools of the Trade
Here’s what’s in my tech stack right now:
* **React & Next.js** for the frontend.
* **Data Factory and Cosmos DB** for handling data.
* **TypeScript** 
* **Service Bus** to keep things moving smoothly.
These tools weren’t just chosen at random, we go through spikes and Key Decision Documents (KDDs) to review the best solutions, they’re helping us tackle the complexity of this project while ensuring scalability and reliability.
### What I’m Learning Along the Way
This project has been a masterclass in growth (and patience):
* **Technically**: I’ve deepened my skills in TypeScript, learned NoSQL, and gotten my first real taste of Azure.
* **Personally**: I’m learning to speak up more (even when it’s uncomfortable) and thinking more holistically about the ripple effects of every line of code.
The accessibility-first mindset I’m developing has been especially rewarding—it’s about building for everyone, not just the average user. Kinda also learning that the 'average' person just doesn't exist. 
### The Bigger Picture
At the end of the day, this project is about creating meaningful impact. I want store colleagues to feel supported by the tools they use, not hindered by them. I also want head office teams to better understand the real challenges faced in stores—because when we know better, we build better.
### Final Thoughts (and Some Advice)
If you’re tackling a similar project, here’s my headline suggestions:
1. Spend time learning about the end user’s experience.
2. Don’t underestimate the importance of accessible design.
3. And finally, brace yourself for the surprises—barcodes, I’m looking at you.
### What’s Next?
For me, it’s all about keeping the momentum going. I’m excited to see how this app will transform in-store processes and continue exploring ways to improve as an engineer. And maybe write a few more blog posts along the way.
If you’ve ever wrangled business logic, battled with a NoSQL query, or found yourself unexpectedly charmed by barcodes, let’s connect! Engineering is better when we share our stories—and our lessons learned.
