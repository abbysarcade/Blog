## From Hidden Contributor to Visible Leader: How to Get Recognised for Your Work in Tech
Ever feel like you’re the unsung hero of your team? You’re fixing bugs, pushing code, and driving projects forward, but somehow, no one seems to notice. It’s like you’re the Wi-Fi: invisible, taken for granted, but everyone panics when you’re not working.

Being great at what you do isn’t always enough to get recognised. You need to make sure people know you’re great. That’s not about bragging—it’s about building a personal brand and letting your contributions shine. So, let’s stop being the hidden gem of your organisation and start positioning yourself as a visible leader in your field. Here’s how.
### Step 1: Build Your Personal Brand (Yes, You Have One)
Think of a personal brand as what people say about you when you’re not in the room. Are you the go-to person for clean code? The team motivator? The debugger whisperer? If you don’t know, it’s time to figure it out.

Start by asking yourself:
* What do I want to be known for?
* What unique skills or perspectives do I bring to the table?
* How can I consistently showcase these?

Your brand doesn’t have to be flashy. In fact, for the most part, authenticity wins. Maybe you’re known for making documentation less painful (heroic). Or perhaps you’re the one who always asks the tricky questions in retros (legend). Lean into those strengths and own them.

**Understand your purpose**. This will guide you in shaping your personal brand. A solid sense of purpose aligns everything you do—both in and outside of your job. If you haven’t already, check out resources like Simon Sinek’s "Start with Why" or Daniel Pink’s "Drive" to get clear on what motivates you.

**Pro tip**: Working for a company whose purpose aligns with yours is game-changing. For example, that’s how I found myself at Co-op. Their values clicked with mine, and it’s been a huge motivator to keep raising my visibility.
### Step 2: Communicate Clearly (and Often)
**Share your wins**: Talk about your achievements in stand-ups, team meetings, or even Slack channels. “Hey, the API integration is done” sounds good. “The API integration is done, and it’s 25% faster now” sounds better.

**Ask for feedback**: This shows you’re engaged and helps you grow. Plus, it reminds people you’re here, doing the work, and makes them think about what you bring to the table (or desk...).

**Speak their language**: Tailor your communication to your audience. Keep it simple for non-tech folks and detailed for your fellow engineers. Acronyms are not your friends unless you explain them.
### Step 3: Stop Being Humble (Seriously)
I get it—humility is a virtue. But at some point, it starts holding you back. If you’re always deflecting praise, you’re making it harder for others to recognise your achievements. 

Remember, people can’t read your mind. If you don’t tell them how awesome you are, they might never know. That said, don't overdo it and become a walking billboard for your own awesomeness. It’s about balance—know when to speak up and when to let your work speak for you.
### Step 4: Learn Your Natural Superpowers
I am naturally confident and outspoken, which makes it easier for me to speak up in meetings. But I understand this isn’t the case for everyone. If you’re more introverted, it doesn’t mean you can’t raise your visibility—it just means you may need to push yourself a little more.

Discover what comes naturally to you and lean into those superpowers. Maybe you’re an incredible problem-solver, or perhaps you have a unique way of simplifying complex topics. Whatever it is, own it and use it to your advantage.
### Step 5: Be Honest About What You Don’t Know
You know that person who acts like they know everything? Yeah, don’t be them. Admitting when you don’t know something is surprisingly powerful.

It builds trust, makes you approachable, and opens the door for collaboration. Next time someone asks you about quantum computing and you have no idea, just say: “Honestly, I don’t know, but I’d love to learn about it.” It’s not a weakness; it’s an opportunity.
### Step 6: Be Comfortable Being Wrong
If you’re not making mistakes, you’re probably not challenging yourself enough. The key is to own your mistakes when they happen.

Imagine this scenario: You suggested a solution. It turned out to be a bad idea (oops). Instead of doubling down, you said, “Turns out I was wrong about that. Here’s what I learned.”

Congratulations, you just gained more respect than if you’d been right all along. Leadership isn’t about being perfect; it’s about learning and improving. Embrace the learning curve.
### Step 7: Contribute to the Wider Tech Community
Raising your profile internally is great, but why stop there? Sharing your knowledge with the broader tech community can elevate you to a visible leader.

Here’s how:
* **Write blog posts**: Share lessons learned, tools you love, or how you solved a particularly nasty bug. (Hello, imposter syndrome! Writing helps you fight it.)
* **Speak at events**: Start small, like team demos or meetups, and work your way up.
* **Engage online**: Join discussions on Twitter, LinkedIn, or tech forums. Comment, share, and start conversations.
* **Open source contributions**: Sharing your code is like saying, “I know my stuff, and I’m happy to help.”

### Step 8: Let Your Work Speak—But Also Speak About Your Work
A common myth in tech is that “the work speaks for itself.” It doesn’t. People are busy, and your contributions might get overlooked unless you highlight them.

That doesn’t mean plastering “LOOK WHAT I DID!” in Comic Sans on every slide deck. It means finding organic ways to share your impact:
* In retros, explain what you contributed and why it mattered.
* In team updates, connect your work to business goals.
* In one-to-ones, talk about the challenges you’ve overcome and your ideas for improvement.
### Step 9: Build Others Up Along the Way
The best leaders aren’t just visible themselves; they make others visible too. Spotlight a teammate’s contribution in a meeting. Share credit for a project. Advocate for the quiet voices in the room.

When you help others shine, it doesn’t dim your light—it makes the whole team brighter. And guess who they’ll remember as a leader? You.
### Final Thoughts: It’s Not About Ego; It’s About Impact
Raising your visibility isn’t about shouting “LOOK AT ME!” from the rooftops. It’s about showing how your work makes a difference—for your team, your organisation, and the wider tech community.

So go ahead, own your achievements, share your knowledge, and embrace the occasional stumble along the way. Because the best leaders aren’t invisible—they’re visible, approachable, and unapologetically themselves.
