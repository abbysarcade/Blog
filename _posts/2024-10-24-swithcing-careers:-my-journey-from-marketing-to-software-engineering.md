## Switching Careers: My Journey from Marketing to Software Engineering

Making the leap from marketing to software engineering wasn't exactly a decision I made over a cup of tea one day. It was more like a series of "aha!" moments mixed with frustrations, sprinkled with some accidental successes, and topped off with a global pandemic for good measure. I want to share my story, not just to reflect on how I stumbled into tech, but to offer some real talk for anyone out there contemplating a career change. Spoiler alert: it’s scary—but totally worth it if you’re up for the ride.

### The Beginning: A Story of Frustration (and Silos)
I started my career as a Social Media and Email Marketing Officer at a kitchenware brand, which also had an agency arm. You’d think selling spatulas wouldn’t be all that stressful, but you’d be wrong. Not only did we have clients from every corner of the business world, but we also worked in silos—like, hardcore silos. You know the type: everyone working on their own island of tasks, and no one really sharing a map of what’s going on.

Imagine this: I’d spend hours researching, and creating these (in my mind) stunningly insightful marketing strategies, only to find out a week later that the content team was working on updating the very product I was researching. Great. All that effort, wasted. The constant duplication of work and outdated information started to drive me up the wall.

So, I did what any resourceful zillenial would do—I Googled. We didn’t have a budget for fancy project management tools, so I stumbled across Microsoft Flow (aka Power Automate). With absolutely no coding experience, I somehow cobbled together a low-code task management system. It wasn’t pretty, but it worked. We finally started sharing research, aligning campaigns, and—shockingly—talking to each other!

Of course, not everything went smoothly. I quickly discovered that no-code solutions can feel like sticking a plaster on a bullet wound—effective for about two seconds before it all starts leaking. So, I thought to myself, “Maybe it’d be easier to just learn how to code properly.” Ah, if only I knew what I was getting myself into…

### A Turning Point: Redundancy, Resilience, and a Sales Gig?
Fast forward a few years to January 2020, and I’m sitting in my new role as Digital Marketing Manager at another company, blissfully unaware that the world is about to turn upside down. Enter COVID-19. Like so many others, I was furloughed and—after a few months of daytime telly and one too many banana bread attempts—I got the call. Redundancy. Brilliant.

At first, I did what most people do in that situation—I panicked. Then I realised this could be the push I needed to finally make the leap into tech. I had already spent lockdown doing coding courses online, so I thought, “Right, that’s it. I’m going all in.”

I applied for a master’s degree in Computing at Sunderland University and got accepted. Just as I was preparing to return my work laptop, my manager called me in for a chat. I’d kept in touch with him throughout the redundancy process, just checking in because I come from a family of managers, and I know it’s not easy to let people go. That small gesture must’ve worked, because they offered me a job in… sales. Yep, not the transition I was expecting, but hey, I wasn’t about to turn down a job in the middle of a pandemic.

We struck a deal: I could study while working in sales. I jumped in, and my marketing skills helped me thrive. At the same time, I was building a relationship with the engineering team, and they were kind enough to mentor me during my studies. (Translation: they tolerated my endless questions about Python and SQL.)

### A Turning Point: Redundancy, Resilience, and a Sales Gig?
A few months later, something unexpected happened. The head of development came to me with a proposition: a role on their engineering team had opened up, and they wanted me to take it—even though I hadn’t even finished my master’s degree. I was floored. I was not expecting to get offered a tech role before I've got the paper to prove I can do it.

I said yes (obviously), and the next year was a whirlwind. I learned a ton on the job—sometimes by doing things right, but mostly by doing things wrong first. And while I loved my time there, it was a small team, and I wanted more opportunities to grow. I jumped ship.

After some job hunting, I landed a spot at a much larger company with loads of room for development. From day one, I was thrown into a bootcamp where I learned Test-Driven Development (TDD) and mob programming. Let me tell you, learning TDD felt like learning to ride a bike, except you’re also coding, and sometimes the bike is on fire. But once you've figured out how to pedal, it's brilliant.

### Reflection: Lessons, and Taking the Plunge
So, what have I learned through all this? First off, redundancy is not the end of the world—sometimes it’s the beginning of something much better. Secondly, if you’re thinking about switching careers, don’t wait for the stars to align. Spoiler alert: they won’t. Start now, ask questions, annoy your colleagues, and dive in.

And finally, the big one: growth happens outside of your comfort zone. I’ve faced more discomfort in this journey than I ever did in marketing, but that’s where the real learning happens.

If you’re on the fence about making a change—whether it’s into tech or any other field—just know that the hardest part is starting. Once you do, you’ll surprise yourself with what you’re capable of. And who knows? Maybe one day, you’ll look back on the chaos and think, “Well, that was fun, wasn’t it?”

Your career is yours to shape—so make it an adventure worth telling.
