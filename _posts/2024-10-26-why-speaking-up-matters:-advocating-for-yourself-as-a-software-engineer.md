##Why Speaking Up Matters: Advocating for Yourself as a Software Engineer.
As software engineers, our work often speaks for us in the form of the code we write, the features we ship, and the bugs we… well, (hopefully) squash. But I’ve found that actually speaking up can be just as important—especially when it comes to gaining visibility, building a personal brand, and growing as a leader in the field.

Switching from a marketing background to software engineering has been an adventure in self-advocacy. It’s meant learning to speak up for my ideas, to explain the impact of my work, and (perhaps most challengingly) to convince people I actually know what I’m doing! I’ve often found myself possessing the soft skills of more senior roles before I have the technical whiz to match, which means I've needed to remind management that I was able to focus more entirely on technical skills as I progressed. Here’s a bit of what I’ve learned along the way about why speaking up in tech isn’t just important but vital—and how we can make it work for us.

First of all, let’s talk about the code. We’re closest to it, and that means we see the pitfalls, bugs, and opportunities for improvement. And, if you’re like me, you also see those “little” usability issues that might leave users cursing under their breath (we’ve all been there). One of the first ways I started advocating for myself and my team was by voicing these potential snags early on. For instance, thanks to my in-store experience too many moons ago, I noticed that a few features in our app could lead to confusion for end-users. Speaking up here wasn’t just about showing my value, it was about making sure we delivered a smoother, more polished product. Over time, I realised that fostering an environment where everyone felt safe to raise similar points would mean a better product and a happier team.

When you advocate for your work and your skills, you’re giving leadership a better sense of what you bring to the team. Think about it: no one will know how hard you worked to unravel a tricky bug, or that you've mastered a new skill unless you say something! Early on, I thought the work would speak for itself, but I learned pretty quickly that we also need to be our own PR team (that's public relations, not pull request...). When you stay silent, your impact can go unnoticed—especially if you’re balancing both technical progress and personal development goals, like many of us are.

Self-advocacy has also shown me how important it is to balance confidence with humility. Yes, you want to highlight your achievements, but not at the cost of sounding like you’ve recently started a fan club for yourself. Finding this balance has been essential; it’s helped me build respect within my team and allowed me to acknowledge areas where I still need growth. Being vocal about both your strengths and your struggles creates respect and trust with colleagues and opens doors for support when you need it.

Plus, in an open, communicative environment, everyone benefits—especially newer team members who rely on transparent discussions to learn. When I started speaking up more often, I noticed it encouraged others to do the same. It’s easy to forget that asking questions, proposing ideas, and sharing “aha!” moments can help newer teammates learn by osmosis. I’ve learned so much more through mentoring and advocating for others than I have in any other element of my role.

Then there’s the big one: tackling fear of being wrong. I know, I know—imposter syndrome is practically the software engineer's rite of passage. Early on, I would second-guess whether what I had to say was “important enough” to share. Eventually, though, I realised that holding back because of fear meant missing out on growth. And let’s face it: if I’m wrong, I’m wrong, but at least I’ve learned something (and probably shared a laugh along the way). Getting past that fear is a mental hurdle, but the payoff in team learning and personal growth is well worth it.

There’s also the unique challenge of explaining technical concepts to non-technical teammates. Ever tried to explain a tricky debugging issue to a stakeholder? It can feel like trying to explain to a fish how to climb a tree, often resulting in the same glossed-over look I get whenever someone tries to talk to me about _______ Practising clear communication has become essential for me. I’ve found that breaking things down and simplifying complex topics can mean the difference between someone backing your idea or dismissing it entirely.

It’s all about striking a balance: advocating for your ideas thoughtfully and showing you’re open to feedback. This openness has helped me build credibility within my team, giving me the freedom to speak up and contribute to technical discussions without fear. And when it comes to navigating hierarchy, I used to think titles would make my input feel less valid, especially around senior colleagues. But the reality is that fresh ideas and new perspectives only make us stronger. By showing respect and a constructive mindset, I’ve found that most people welcome the input, no matter where it comes from, and the ones that don't usually aren't worth the effort.

And, finally, timing can make a huge difference. Sometimes a well-placed “Hey, have we considered…?” at the right moment can open up a whole new perspective for the team. But if everyone’s racing towards a deadline, it might be worth jotting down your idea and raising it at a better time. And as a general rule: if you’re bringing up a concern, try bringing a solution along with it. This has shown my team that I’m not just looking for problems but actively working on ways to improve things—giving me a stronger reputation and a better chance of getting my ideas heard.

So, let me leave you with some advice from the great philosopher of our time, RuPaul: “If you can’t love yourself, how in the hell are you gonna love somebody else?” Speaking up for yourself and believing in your voice can make a world of difference in your career. From enhancing product quality to facilitating personal growth, the benefits are clear. Plus, by finding the courage to advocate for ourselves, we’re helping create an environment where everyone’s voice matters—making it just a little easier for the next person to find theirs.
