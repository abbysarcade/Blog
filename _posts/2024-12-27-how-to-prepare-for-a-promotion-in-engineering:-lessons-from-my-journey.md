## How to Prepare for a Promotion in Engineering: Lessons from My Journey
Ah, the engineering career ladder—equal parts thrilling and terrifying.  I’ve been there, sweating through imposter syndrome and second-guessing if I was “ready.” 

In this blog, I’ll share the lessons I’ve learned along the way, from debugging my skill gaps to making sure my manager knew I wasn’t just there to keep a seat warm. Let’s dive into how you can level up, both technically and personally, and turn those promotion dreams into a reality.
### Step 1: Understand the Role You’re Aiming For
Think of it like reverse engineering—how can you optimise for something if you don’t know what it’s supposed to do? When I set my sights on each promotion I didn’t just skim the job description; I dissected it.
* **What does the role *really* require?** Talk to people already in that position. What do they spend their days doing? (Hint: It’s not just writing code.)
* **Ask yourself tough questions**. Do you enjoy mentoring? Leading projects? Do you know your way around stakeholder conversations?

Being honest about what the role entails (and whether you actually *want* it) will help you avoid future “What have I done?” moments.
### Step 2: Evaluate Yourself Honestly
Honest self-evaluation is like doing a code review for your career: sometimes painful, but essential.

I asked myself:
* What am I great at? (Debugging, problem-solving, consuming entire packs of biscuits during sprint planning.)
* Where am I falling short? (Architecture design, giving concise updates without a novel-length explanation.)

Here’s a tip: If self-assessment feels too biased or vague, enlist ChatGPT for help. Ask it to generate interview questions for the role you want and test your answers. You’ll quickly uncover areas where you need to improve—and it’s less scary than grilling yourself in front of a mirror.
### Step 3: Get Feedback (The Specific Kind)
Feedback is the secret sauce to growth, but only if it’s *specific*. A vague “You’re doing great!” doesn’t help when you’re trying to figure out if you’re ready to lead a team.

What worked for me was asking targeted questions like:
* “Do you think I’m ready to lead more technical discussions?”
* “What gaps should I work on to move into a senior role?”
* “Am I on track, or should I start Googling ‘alternative careers for overthinkers’?”

Your manager and colleagues can provide insights that you might overlook. Plus, asking shows you’re serious about growth.
### Step 4: Find Mentors, Coaches, and Communities
No engineer is an island, and neither is your promotion journey. Mentors and career coaches can offer guidance you didn’t even know you needed(see my [Voltron blog](https://abbysarcade.github.io/2024/11/12/building-your-engineering-voltron-how-mentors,-coaches,-and-managers-shape-your-career.html)). For me, a mentor was like a Stack Overflow for career advice—always there to debug my worries and offer the next steps, the answer isn't always perfect but you always learn something.

Beyond that, engaging with the tech community was a game-changer. Attend meetups, join LinkedIn discussions, or even write blog posts (like this one). Sharing knowledge and networking aren’t just resume fillers; they build confidence and visibility.
### Step 5: Take Opportunities for Growth (Even the Scary Ones)
If I had a pound for every time someone said, “Step out of your comfort zone,” I’d own a house in the Chester by now, or just own a house for that matter. But here’s the thing: it’s true.

When opportunities arose to lead meetings, take on unfamiliar projects, or tackle a gnarly piece of legacy code, I said yes—even when my brain screamed, “You’re going to fail spectacularly!”

The result? I learned faster than I thought possible, and those challenges became evidence of my readiness for promotion.
### Step 6: Be Clear About Your Goals
People can’t read your mind (thank goodness). If you’re working towards a promotion, let your manager and teammates know. During 1:1s, I made it clear:
* What I wanted (to grow into the next role).
* Why I thought I was ready (or what I was doing to get there).
* How they could help (feedback, opportunities, and moral support).
This isn’t being pushy—it’s being intentional. And intentionality makes people take notice.
### Step 7: Build Your Confidence and Brand
A critical lesson I learned? Stop being humble. You’re not bragging if you highlight your achievements; you’re ensuring your work gets the recognition it deserves.

Here’s how:
* Share wins in team meetings or Slack, especially when they align with business goals.
* Keep a journal of your accomplishments—it’s a great pick-me-up and prep for performance reviews.
* Find your natural strengths (or “superpowers”) and lean into them. Mine? I’m naturally outspoken and confident, which makes me comfortable advocating for ideas or questioning decisions.
### Final Thoughts: Growth Is Messy, but Worth It
Preparing for a promotion is as much about mindset as it is about skill. You’ll have moments of doubt, failures that sting, and, importantly, wins. That’s all part of the process.

So take the time to reflect, get uncomfortable, and show the world what you’re capable of. Because if there’s one thing I’ve learned, it’s this: the only thing worse than pushing yourself is wondering what would’ve happened if you had.

Now, go forth and claim that next role—you got this!
