## Leveraging Your Professional Network as a Software Engineer
When you hear the word "networking," you might picture forced smiles, limp handshakes, and someone trying to sell you on a “once-in-a-lifetime” crypto scheme. But in the world of software engineering, your professional network is less about business cards and buzzwords and more about genuine connections—and, sometimes, unexpected salsa classes.

Here’s a look at how my network has shaped my career and how you can build, maintain, and make the most of yours, with a few real-life stories along the way.
### The Power of Networking: My Greatest Hits
#### Salsa, Slimming World, and Serendipity
Let’s kick things off with some unusual networking moments:
* My dad once met someone at a salsa class who was looking to break into software engineering. Dad casually mentioned my job, and the next thing I knew, I was coaching this person on TDD, mob programming, and interview techniques. Two years later, they’re thriving as a software engineer.
* A friend's mum met someone at Slimming World with a job opening. One casual introduction later, my friend landed a career that suits him perfectly. Networking, it seems, comes with zero-calorie benefits.
* One of my closest work friendships? It all started with a shared love of bolognese recipes. Yes, pasta brought us together, and now we collaborate like pros (with the occasional debate over the correct pasta shape).

#### The Festival Film Crew
While working at a festival, a colleague mentioned they dreamed of becoming a videographer. By pure coincidence, a film crew arrived to capture content. They introduced themselves, and that introduction turned into hands-on experience and a growing portfolio.
#### COVID-Era PHP Meetups
During the lockdown, I attended PHP meetups from all over the UK—one of the few upsides of virtual events. When I started job hunting, those connections led to three interviews. It turns out you can network effectively in pyjamas.
### Building Your Network: Where to Start
#### Look Around You
Your network doesn’t have to be a LinkedIn empire; start with the people you already know:
* **Colleagues**: Past and present teammates can offer insights, opportunities, and referrals.
* **Friends and Family**: You never know when your dad’s salsa partner will be your next mentee.
* **Online Communities**: From GitHub to Slack, tech communities are brimming with talent and advice.

#### Make Yourself Useful
Networking isn’t about what people can do for you; it’s about creating mutual value:
* Connect colleagues to opportunities, like I did for a store colleague who dreamed of becoming a software engineer. They’ve applied to be part of our early careers programme.
* Share resources, whether it’s a job posting, an article, or even just a listening ear.
* Be the person who encourages others to put themselves forward.

Generosity not only feels good—it builds goodwill that often comes back to you in surprising ways.
### Keep the Spark Alive
Once you’ve built a network, you need to nurture it:
#### Stay in Touch
A simple message like, “Hey, saw this and thought of you!” can keep relationships warm without feeling forced. Pro tip: Everyone appreciates a good meme now and then.
#### Celebrate Wins
A quick “Congrats!” on LinkedIn or a like on their post goes a long way. 
#### Don’t Forget In-Person Connections
While I love the efficiency of online networking, nothing beats a face-to-face chat (and perhaps a slice of pizza at a meetup).
### When to Call on Your Network
#### Job Hunting
When I was searching for roles, I let my network know I was looking. Sure, it’s awkward, but a simple, “Hey, I’m exploring new opportunities—let me know if you hear of anything!” can open unexpected doors.
#### Mentorship
Networks aren’t just about jobs; they’re about growth. I’ve sought advice from seasoned engineers and offered my own insights to aspiring ones.
#### Collaboration
From co-authoring blogs to brainstorming at meetups, your network is full of potential partners for exciting projects.
### Final Thoughts: Your Network is Your Community
Networking isn’t about collecting contacts; it’s about building relationships. Whether it’s connecting over shared interests (like bolognese) or creating opportunities for others (like coaching someone through their first tech role), it’s those authentic moments that make a difference.

So, embrace the awkwardness, be generous, and remember: the next big opportunity might just come from someone your dad met at salsa class.
