## The Power of Giving and Receiving Feedback as a Software Engineer
Feedback. That magical word that can either make your day or have you contemplating your life choices over a cup of overpriced coffee you bought to make yourself feel better. But here’s the thing: feedback, when done right, is one of the most powerful tools for personal and team growth. As engineers, we often focus on the technical—clean code, efficient pipelines, optimal algorithms—but what about the soft skills that hold everything together?

Let’s talk about feedback: the good, the bad, and the awkward.
### Why Feedback Matters
Think of feedback as the git history of your career. Each piece of feedback is a commit, contributing to the version of you that exists today. Sure, some commits might be more “fix typo” than “refactor entire module,” but they all add up to progress.

In the fast-paced, ever-evolving world of software engineering, regular feedback is your secret weapon. It helps you:
* Identify blind spots you didn’t even know you had.
* Align with team goals and values.
* Build trust and stronger working relationships.

Without it, you’re essentially coding without tests—sure, things might seem fine on the surface, but everything falls over when the wind blows.

### Giving Feedback: It's a Skill, Not an Afterthought

Let’s start with giving feedback, because who doesn’t love a good *code review analogy*? When reviewing code, you don’t just say, “This is bad.” You highlight why and suggest improvements. Feedback for people should work the same way.

Here’s my approach:
1. **Ask Permission**

“Are you open to feedback?” is a game-changer. It sets the tone and ensures the person is in the right headspace. Feedback landing on a bad day is like trying to deploy on a Friday—just don’t.

2. **Understand Their Goals**

Feedback is most effective when it aligns with the recipient’s objectives. If someone’s goal is to improve their debugging skills, telling them to speak up more won’t hit the mark.

3. **Be Specific and Actionable**

Saying, “You’re not great at communication” is vague and unhelpful. Instead, try, “In yesterday’s meeting, I noticed you avoided addressing the client’s question directly. Practising assertiveness could make your points clearer.”

4. **Feedback Sandwiches Are Outdated**

I mean, who likes a soggy middle? Instead, focus on creating trust so you can give feedback directly but constructively. If they trust your intentions, they’ll take it as a gift, not a slap.
### Receiving Feedback: A Masterclass in Staying Cool
Ah, the joys of receiving feedback. If you’re anything like me, your initial reaction to unexpected feedback might be: “Wait, you mean I’m not perfect?” (Shock. Horror.)

But here’s the truth: thoughts aren’t facts. Feedback isn’t gospel; it’s someone’s perspective. And that’s okay!

Here’s how to take feedback like the pro you are:

1. **Listen First, React Later**

Avoid jumping to defence mode. Take a deep breath (or three), and really hear what’s being said. It goes back to the 'listen to understand' rather than listening to respond.

2. **Ask Questions**

Don’t be afraid to dig deeper. “Can you give me an example of when this happened?” helps clarify the feedback and makes it actionable.

3. **Feedback on Feedback**

If you disagree with the feedback or feel it’s incomplete, say so! “I see your point about X, but here’s why I approached it that way” keeps the dialogue open.

4. **Know Your Priorities**

If the feedback doesn’t align with your immediate goals, communicate that. “That’s a great point, but right now I’m focusing on improving my design skills. Let’s revisit this later.”
### Making Feedback Part of Your Culture
Feedback isn’t a one-off event; it’s a habit. Here’s how to make it a regular part of your team dynamics:
1. **Promote Regular Feedback Sessions**

Whether it’s retros, 1:1s, or quick chats, make space for feedback. Think of it as your team’s CI/CD pipeline for growth.

2. **Set Clear Goals**

Be open about what you’re working on and encourage others to do the same. Share your “roadmap for improvement” and ask for input on how to get there.

3. **Model Feedback Behaviours**

Show vulnerability by sharing the feedback you’ve received and how you’re acting on it. This normalises the process and encourages others to do the same.

4. **Invest Time in Feedback Conversations**

One of my favourite practices is following up on feedback I’ve been given. I’ve had some fantastic sessions with colleagues where we unpacked their comments and explored actionable steps I could take.
### Final Thoughts: Feedback Is a Gift

At the end of the day, feedback is like debugging your personal and professional life. It’s not always comfortable, but it’s necessary for growth. The more you embrace it, the more you’ll see the results—in your skills, your relationships, and your career.

So, next time someone offers you feedback, remember: it’s not a critique; it’s a compliment. They’re investing their time in helping you improve. And if you’re giving feedback, do it with care, clarity, and a sprinkle of humour.

Happy debugging (of the human kind)!
