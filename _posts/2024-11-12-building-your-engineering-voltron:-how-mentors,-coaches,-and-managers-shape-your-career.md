## Building Your Engineering Voltron: How Mentors, Coaches, and Managers Shape Your Career
When I first stumbled across Lara Hogan’s brilliant concept of the Manager Voltron (seriously, if you haven’t read [her post](https://larahogan.me/blog/manager-voltron/) yet, do it now), something clicked for me. My own “career Voltron” isn’t just made up of managers—it’s a combination of mentors, career coaches, and colleagues who have played pivotal roles in my growth as an engineer.

In this post, I’ll share how assembling my own Voltron of support has helped me navigate challenges, celebrate wins, and—most importantly—keep learning. Whether you’re an engineer or a job seeker, I hope this inspires you to build your network of support.

### Why Every Engineer Needs a Voltron
Let’s face it: engineering can be overwhelming. One minute, you’re confidently squashing bugs; the next, your new feature has somehow broken everything. This is where your Voltron comes in—a trusted group of people offering guidance, reality checks, and the occasional pep talk when you need it most.

Over my career, I’ve built a Voltron of incredible people who’ve helped me grow in ways I couldn’t have managed alone. Each member contributes something unique, forming a powerhouse of support. Here’s how they’ve shaped my journey.

### The Catalysts: Mentors Who Spot Potential
#### The Early Believer
Before I officially became an engineer, Mikey recognised something in me that I hadn’t yet seen in myself. At the time, we were colleagues at a small marketing agency in Durham. Mikey had five years of engineering experience under his belt, while I was knee-deep in a Master’s degree, juggling a career in marketing and learning to code.

Mikey didn’t just support my transition into tech—he gave me my first engineering role before I graduated. Later, as my manager, he taught me the importance of curiosity, determination, and embracing the endless cycle of trial and error that defines life as a junior engineer. He’s the kind of person you want in your corner, whether you’re dealing with a production outage or navigating a career change.

#### The Natural Mentor
When I joined Co-op, I had a clear goal: grow into a senior engineering role. Mitch, a senior engineer looking for a mentoring opportunity, quickly became an integral part of that journey.

Even before officially becoming my mentor, Mitch offered valuable side-of-desk advice, regularly sharing observations about what I was doing well and where I could improve. Over the past two years, he’s been my go-to for actionable feedback, prep for big challenges, and even the occasional rant. Our relationship is a two-way street, and that reciprocity is what makes it truly impactful.

### The Strategists: Career Coaches Who Provide Clarity
#### The Industry Navigator
When I set my sights on a promotion, I realised I needed more than technical skills—I needed to understand the broader industry landscape. Rob, a colleague with a knack for strategic thinking, became my career coach.

Rob has a unique ability to pinpoint where I hold myself back and to challenge me in constructive ways. He’s helped me turn vague aspirations into clear goals with actionable steps. Thanks to his guidance, I’ve grown not just as an engineer but also as someone who can confidently chart their career path.

### The Anchors: Managers Who Steer the Ship
#### The Superpower Spotter
Gemma, my first manager at Co-op, did something extraordinary: she reframed my past career and neurodiversity as assets, not obstacles. She showed me how to leverage my unique perspective to add value to the team and taught me that engineering is about more than just writing code—it’s about collaboration, communication, and empathy.

#### The Business Expert
Andy, my current manager, has been instrumental in guiding my growth. He’s supported me through two promotion processes, offering clarity and encouragement. Andy’s deep understanding of Co-op’s systems and processes has been invaluable, and his combination of steady belief in my abilities and strategic challenges has made all the difference during moments of doubt.

### The Allies: Colleagues Who Have Your Back
#### The Constructive Feedbackers
Colleagues who offer constructive, actionable feedback are worth their weight in gold. Whether it’s sharing personal experiences, pointing out blind spots, or recommending great resources, these allies help elevate the entire team.

#### The Educators
When I first joined Co-op, I participated in a boot camp that introduced me to foundational practices like TDD and mob programming. This not only equipped me with essential skills but also connected me to a supportive community of new engineers.
Our code club, led by Keith, continues to foster learning and curiosity. Keith’s depth of knowledge and willingness to answer even the strangest programming questions make him an indispensable part of our engineering community.

### Building Your Own Voltron
Feeling inspired to build your career Voltron? Here are some tips to get started:
* Be curious: Reach out to people whose skills or careers you admire. A simple “Can I ask for your advice?” can open doors to meaningful relationships.
* Be open: Look for people who will challenge you, not just those who’ll praise you. Remember, growth happens outside your comfort zone.
* Be generous: Relationships are a two-way street. Share your insights and support in return, whether this be with your mentors or passing your learnings forward.

### Wrapping Up
Your career Voltron—whether it’s mentors, career coaches, managers, or colleagues—can transform your professional journey. They’ll guide you through challenges, celebrate your wins, and keep you striving for growth.

If there’s one thing to take from this post, it’s this: go out and build your Voltron. And don’t forget to thank the people who’ve helped you along the way. I know I wouldn’t be where I am today without mine.
