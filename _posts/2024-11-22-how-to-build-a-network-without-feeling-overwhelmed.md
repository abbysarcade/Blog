## How to Build a Network Without Feeling Overwhelmed
Networking. For some, it’s an exciting chance to meet new people and share ideas. For others (myself included, at times), it’s a phrase that can conjure up images of awkward small talk, business cards, and a sneaky look at the clock wondering how much longer you need to stick it out.

But here’s the thing: networking doesn’t have to feel like a chore. It’s not about collecting as many contacts as possible—it’s about building genuine relationships. And with a few practical tips (and a bit of humour), you can turn networking into something that feels manageable, authentic, and dare I say, enjoyable.
### 1. Start with What You’ve Got
Your network is already bigger than you think—it’s just waiting to be activated. It’s made up of:
* Former classmates (the ones who turned up to group projects and the ones who didn’t).
* Colleagues, past and present.
* Friends from hobbies or social circles.
* That person on LinkedIn who keeps liking your posts but you’ve never actually spoken to.

Building a network doesn’t mean cold-calling strangers or working a room. Start by reconnecting with people you already know. A quick LinkedIn message or a “How have you been?” text can go a long way.
### 2. Engage, Don’t Just Observe
We’ve all been guilty of the “silent scroller” routine—liking a post, maybe sharing an article, and then moving on. But true networking is about showing up, even if it’s digitally.
* Comment on posts to start a conversation.
* Share insights that have genuinely helped you.
* Celebrate others’ wins (a little cheerleading never hurt anyone).

Think of it like a party: you wouldn’t just stand in the corner, nodding occasionally. 
### 3. Get to Know the Whole Person
Networking isn’t just about swapping CVs or LinkedIn profiles—it’s about connecting with people on a human level. Ask about their hobbies, challenges, or that random collection of model trains in their background during video calls.

I follow the “whole person theory”—value people for who they are, not just what they do. Lead with honesty and empathy, and you’ll find that relationships built this way tend to last.
### 4. Lean on Your Interests
If networking events aren’t your thing, find connections through shared hobbies. Love running? Join a local club. Into board games? Meetup has a group for that. For me, I’ve made some of my best professional connections through shared interests—and it never even felt like “networking.”

Pro tip: talking about your sourdough starter or Skyrim(it's that time of year again) is far more fun than discussing corporate buzzwords.
### 5. Give Before You Get
Networking is a two-way street. The easiest way to make a connection is to start by offering something.
* Share useful advice or resources.
* Recommend someone for a job.
* Introduce people who’d work well together.

When you approach networking with generosity, people naturally want to return the favour. 
### 6. Keep It Manageable
Networking doesn’t have to mean attending massive events that drain your social battery. Start small:
* Grab coffee with someone you admire.
* Have a casual chat at work or after a meeting.
* Join a small group with shared interests (even virtually).

Quality always beats quantity. A single meaningful connection is worth more than dozens of superficial ones.
### 7. Accept That Awkward Moments Happen
Networking isn’t always smooth sailing. I once met five colleagues at a work event, where we bonded over winding each other all night. The next day, I learned they were all in the senior leadership team. Lovely people, though.

Another time, a colleague spent 25 minutes telling me how rubbish they thought an app was—only to find out I built it. That colleague? Now one of my closest friends.

These moments remind us that networking isn’t about perfection. It’s about being human, awkwardness and all.
### A Quick Detour: The Wisdom of 'Join or Die'
If you’re on Netflix, I highly recommend watching Join or Die. It explores why social connection matters—not just professionally, but in life. The documentary dives into how building strong networks can shape careers, communities, and even entire movements. It’s a brilliant reminder that we’re stronger together, even if the first step is a bit uncomfortable.
### Why Does This Matter?
Your network isn’t just a collection of names; it’s a support system, a sounding board, and a source of inspiration. Building genuine connections means you’re not just creating opportunities—you’re creating a community.
### Final Thought
Networking is less about "working the room" and more about finding your people. Start where you’re comfortable, take small steps, and let your personality shine.

And if all else fails, just ask people about their pets. Trust me—it works every time.
