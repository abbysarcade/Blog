## How to Collaborate Across Teams in a Large Organisation
Collaboration across teams in a large organisation can sometimes feel like herding cats—if those cats also had their own managers, agendas, and were debating whether or not you should even be herding them in the first place. Yet when it works, cross-team collaboration is the secret ingredient for turning ambitious projects into success stories.

Here’s what I’ve learned about working across teams, especially in a place like Co-op, where the business is huge, the stakes are high, and the cooperation is baked into the name. Spoiler: it’s less about formal processes and more about people.
### Start with Shared Goals (and Admit When You’re Not Ready)
Agile tells us to move fast, but sometimes, you need to pump the brakes. Take our journey from sprints to Kanban and back.

We started using sprints, full of ceremonies like planning and retros, but it quickly became clear we weren’t mature enough as a team. We were just ticking boxes, not seeing the benefits. Switching to Kanban gave us breathing room to grow, learn to collaborate better, and focus on delivering value.

When we revisited sprints later, we’d matured as a team, and suddenly, they worked. The takeaway? Collaboration means listening to your team, admitting what’s not working, and being flexible enough to change. Agile isn’t about Agile™—it’s about agility.
### Keep Communication Accessible (Because It’s More Than Just Screen Readers)
Accessibility in communication goes beyond legal requirements or digital tools. It’s about making sure everyone—regardless of their role, first language, or tech expertise—can understand what’s going on.
* **Use plain English**: Not everyone speaks “*corporate*” or “*tech*.”
* **Explain acronyms*: Your UAT(User Acceptance Testing) might be someone else’s WTF (What the Fu~~ck~~...dge?).
* **Follow best practices**: Reduce cognitive load by sticking to clear, consistent formats.
This matters even more in cross-disciplinary teams. At Co-op, we’re mindful that collaboration isn’t about showing off your vocabulary; it’s about making sure everyone’s on the same page.
### Ask, Don’t Tell
One piece of feedback I’ve been working on is to ditch phrases like “that won’t work.” Instead, I now ask, “Can you walk me through why this decision was made?” The result? Less friction, more understanding, and fewer awkward silences in meetings.

Collaboration thrives when you approach disagreements with curiosity, not combativeness. After all, nobody enjoys feeling dismissed—whether it’s their idea or their entire team’s approach.
### Inclusion Is a Collaboration Superpower
True collaboration happens when everyone feels they can contribute. Whether it’s the loudest person in the room or the quietest, their input matters.

Once, during a planning session, a colleague flagged a problem with our workflow. It wasn’t in scope, and we’d already signed off on the design, but they were spot on. Listening to their perspective saved us weeks of rework.

Inclusivity isn’t just for meetings. It’s in the tools we use, the language we choose, and the way we celebrate wins. In the northeast, we have a saying, “Shy bairns get nowt,” but sometimes, it’s up to you to make sure those shy bairns feel comfortable speaking up.
### Celebrate the Small Wins
Big projects are marathons, not sprints (pun intended). Celebrating the small victories along the way keeps teams motivated and builds stronger relationships.

During one particularly tricky project, we fixed a major bug that had been haunting us. Instead of just ticking it off the list, we threw a “Bug Squash Bash” online (COVID times)—cocktails, tunes, and all. It sounds trivial, but those moments of fun and connection are what make cross-team collaboration feel less like work and more like, well, teamwork.
### Final Thoughts: Collaboration Is About People
At the heart of it, collaboration is a relationship. It’s built on trust, shared goals, and a willingness to meet each other halfway (or sometimes three-quarters of the way, if necessary).

So next time you’re wrangling cross-team efforts, keep it simple: listen, communicate clearly, and be agile enough to admit when things aren’t working. Oh, and maybe keep some party playlists handy—you never know when you’ll need to celebrate a win.

Because collaboration doesn’t just make the dream work. It makes the **work**... actually work.
